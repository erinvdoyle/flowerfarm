# <Black Sheep Farm>

## Welcome to Black Sheep Farm, Cut Flower Farm & Venue
The Black Sheep Farm website is an invitation for its visitors to connect with nature. This flower farm and events venue is set in the Wicklow Mountains of Ireland and offers a variety of outdoor activities and purposes: Garden walks, weekend yoga, floral design classes, a cut flower garden to build and bring home a bouquet, and an event space to host special occasions.

Users of the site will be able to find out about the people behind the farm, their origin story, beginning with a move from hectic city life to the Wicklow Mountains, and all of the information therein to either plan a day visit or inquire about booking the farm. There is a class schedule newsletter to subscribe to and a contact form for events. The site is intended for adults of all ages and backgrounds-- anyone who could use more time in nature.
 
We were tasked for our first project with Code Institute to build a site with a minimum of three pages ---. I wanted to create something I felt passionate about, so a romanticized version of our own home with a deep connection to nature fit that parameter. I chose to create this site and name it so as in a different life, my home and the land around it could be Black Sheep Farm. 

Because a wellness website was one of our project prompts, I gavee the business a focus on slow-living, sustainability, and spending time outdoors. This lent itself to the plant and floral-based color palette and the style choices I made along the way. It's so simple to get caught up in the demands of modern life. Sometimes we all need to stop and take a breath, feel the sun on our faces, listen to birdsong, and appreciate the beauty around us; if my site can evoke that sense, or better yet, encourage its viewer to do so, then it has been successful. Every project is a journey in itself, and on this one, I leaned on visual inspiration from talented photographers and learned to let the design of the site follow organically.

## UX Design
The design began with a photo of a field of dahlias for inspiration and the building of wireframes in Balsamiq. 

The 5 Planes of UX Design guided this process:

1. STRATEGY -
   To achieve a visually pleasing web experience that evokes a connection to nature and invites its visitors to plan either a day or an event out at the farm.

2. SCOPE -
   i.  An enticing landing page that displays the beauty of the farm's flowers while inviting visitors with a simple layout to explore further.
   ii. A feel good origin story about literal and metaphorical black sheep and a mission statement to connect with the reader.
   iii. Visit and Events pages to display what the farm offers.

3. STRUCTURE -
   Four pages with clear purposes. Landing, About (titled "Our Story"), Visit, and Events.

4. SKELETON -
   Sketched and then depicted in wireframes

5. SURFACE - 
   A color palette based off of floral hues for images and feature elelemts with a neutral grey background to tie into the logo and farm name. Cards representing each page of the site are used on the landing page for visual interest. Images from the farm are used for the front of the cards and brief explanatory text and a link to the page reveal on hover. Background colors on the backside are taken from landing page images using a color picker. Dark grey text is used in favor of black for ease of reading.
